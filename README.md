# mycli
A command line client for MySQL that can do auto-completion and syntax highlighting.

## Installation

I plan to create DEB, RPM and Brew packages in the future.

If you're familiar with `pip` then you can simply do:

    $ pip install mycli

If you're not familiar with `pip`, here are some steps to get `pip` setup. https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart.html

## Configuration

The config file is located at ~/.pgclirc

## Compatibility

Tests have been run on OS X and Linux. I use it every day on OS X.

I HAVE NOT TESTED THIS IN WINDOWS. But all the libraries used in this app are Windows compatible. So it should work without any modifications. If you're unable to run it on Windows, please file a bug. I will try my best to fix it.
