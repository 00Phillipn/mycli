mycli (1.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add `source` command. This allows running sql statement from a file. 
  * Added a config option to make the warning before destructive commands optional. (Thanks: [Daniel West](https://github.com/danieljwest))
  * Add completion support for CHANGE TO and other master/slave commands. This is still preliminary and it will be enhanced in the future. 
  * Add custom styles to color the menus and toolbars. 
  * Upgrade prompt_toolkit to 0.46. (Thanks: [Jonathan Slenders](https://github.com/jonathanslenders)) 
  * Fix keyword completion after the `WHERE` clause.
  * Add `\g` and `\G` as valid query terminators. Previously in multi-line mode ending a query with a `\G` wouldn't run the query. This is now fixed.
